- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Crainix Learning
- Crainix Learning is a nonprofit that does Advocacy, Research, and Education for Learning and Brain Health. 
- We are currently working on "Understanding Advanced Maths" which is a math program for adult, young, and twice-exceptional students, using a brain-friendly positive education approach so that students can understand advanced maths like set theory, algebra, calculus, vectors, trigonometry, with data examples. Students can go directly into advanced calculus classes or statistics and data science after completing the program. 
- We are adding an option to show what you know by coding in Python. 
- Anyone interested in collaborating, using the curriculum, or participating as a student is welcome to email crainix@outlook.com 
and include enough info or "UAM" in the subject so that we know it is not spam. 

CrainixLearning/CrainixLearning is a âœ¨ special âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
